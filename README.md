# AutomaticSleepScoring
This repository houses advanced automatic scoring scripts designed for the classification of sleep states in rodents. Utilizing a deep neural network architecture, specifically the Boltzmann machine, our approach aims to uncover latent states in rodent sleep and draw correlations to human sleep states
